        <p>Sew Pro is an action-sewing game and not a simulation, so carefully guiding the speeding needle is the most important mechanic! While the game and levels will reference other aspects of sewing, such as racing after a character using tailor’s chalk to accurately complete a design in real-time, we’ll only introduce other actions if they support the core action. These actions could include cutting, drafting and pressing. </p>
        <p>But no matter what the tool, the feeling of controlling that tool is critical to give the satisfying tactile rush of action-sewing.</p>
        <h2>– 2 –</h2>
        <p>By focusing on action-sewing, we give the player opportunities to express themselves in creative ways. </p>
        <p>Embroidery zones, where the player makes their own path through stretches of cloth to hit goals while avoiding obstacles and insect citizens. </p>
        <p>Levels with multiple, divergent routes that affect the final garment’s appearance or allows them to make a snap decision in what order the garment and its details should be completed, greatly affecting the challenge. </p>
        <p>Here are some examples we’ve sketched for you: </p>

      <p>In two player co-op, the players work together on the same pattern. </p>
      <p>If one player makes a mistake and moves off the pattern, the other player can still complete the garment’s objectives. There may also be opportunities to reach objectives that allow the other player to rejoin the in-progress game.</p>
      <p>This dynamic will allows players of different skills to play together, enjoying the shared accomplishment of action-sewing! </p>
